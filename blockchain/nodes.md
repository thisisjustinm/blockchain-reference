## Nodes

Any computer that connects to the Bitcoin network can be called a **node**. A node can be any electronic device, such as a computer, or a serveror even a cellphone.
The role of the node is to maintain a copy of the blockchain and, process the transactions.

Every node on the network is considered equal, however, some nodes may have different roles based on the way the support the Bitcoin network.Bitcoin Blockchain nodes are majorly of two types:
1) Full nodes : A full node stores the complete Bitcoin Blockchain ledger locally. Here, the size of the Bitcoin Blockchain is a problem because the full node will have to store all the Bitcoin transactions that ever happened on the Bitcoin Blockchain.
2) Lightweight or partial nodes : The lightweight nodes or partial nodes donâ€™t store the complete ledger. Instead, they use a simplified payment verification (SPV) mode which only requires them to download a part of the Bitcoin Blockchain. They will connect to full node clients and use filters to ensure that they only receive Bitcoin transactions which are necessary and relevant to their operation.
